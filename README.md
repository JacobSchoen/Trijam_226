# Trijam_226 || Math Attack
The theme for 226 is "You gain a little, you lose a little"

Source code for my entry into [TriJam226](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-226/rate/2145376)

Trijam is a game jam where you have to make something playable (and fun!) in only 3 hours!

# Description
Math Attack is a simple survial minigame where you try to stay alive by collecting and dodging orbs as long as you can. 

The player is a blue orb that will grow in size with its health.

Your score is calculated by how long you live for. You health starts at 1 but green positive orbs give you more health while red orbs take away health.

# Controls
Use WASD or arrow keys to move your orb around the game screen 

# Built With
* Vanilla JS
* HTML/CSS
* VS Code

# Future development wants
~*player not able to travel outside game screen
*Player collision to be more accurate on larger sizes~
* Able to use the mouse to control the player
* Increase difficulty of game as time progresses ( more orbs? faster orbs? less positive orbs?)


# Shoutouts
To the myriad of youtube videos on learning how to use canvas within JS and HTML
